## **Predicting NHL Game Outcomes**

The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts NHL game outcomes with an edge over traditional betting sites, which often rely on human sentiment and can be biased.
### **Project Overview**
1. **Data Source**:
   - Ranking of teams : https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2025.html#all_stats
   - Games of the season infos : https://fixturedownload.com/results/nhl-202

2. **Home Advantage**:
   - Home teams historically have a higher win rate due to factors like travel, crowd support, and familiarity with the venue.
   - In this dataset, the overall home win rate is **53.6%**.

3. **Objective**:
   - Beat the baseline home win rate using machine learning models.
   - Make Money using probability arbitrages
   - Track model performance throughout the season and make incremental improvements.
     
### **Model Evaluation**
The primary evaluation metric is the **F1 Score**, which balances precision and recall to measure model quality.
- **Baseline F1 Score** (assuming the home team always wins): **0.3891**.

# **V2**

## **Improvements from V1**
- Incorporated **Kelly Criterion** for betting size  
- Adjusted the **model data selection** (Permutation and Data Importance)  
- Added **scraping for data inputs** (Selenium and BeautifulSoup)  
- Simplified the **model optimization process**  
- Added **explicative variables**  
- **Easier input process** for user interaction

## **Data Scraping Sources**
### **Extracted Data:**
- **Ranking of teams:** [Hockey-Reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2025.html#all_stats) *(via Selenium)*  
- **Season game results:** [Fixture Download](https://fixturedownload.com/results/nhl-202) *(via BeautifulSoup)*  

---

## **Data Cleaning & Formatting**
- Removed **unplayed games** by dropping rows with missing scores  
- Converted **date, scores, and win status** into proper formats  
- Sorted data **chronologically** for consistency  

---

## **Feature Engineering**
- **Last 10 Wins:** Tracks team performance in recent matches  
- **Played Yesterday:** Identifies back-to-back games  
- **Win Rate:** Computes historical win percentage for home & away teams  
- **Overall Win Streak:** Tracks consecutive wins/losses  
- **Opponent Strength:** Measures the average ranking of past opponents  
- **Rest Days:** Determines time since last game  

---

## **Finding the Best Numerical Features**
- Selected key **performance metrics** as features  
- Tuned **Random Forest & Decision Tree** using **GridSearchCV**  
- Identified top features via **model-based & permutation importance**  
- Ranked models by **F1-score** and saved results for comparison  

ðŸ“Œ **Base Numerical Features F1 Score:** `0.4925`  

---

## **Encoding Team Data for Model Training**
- **Label Encoding** for home and away teams  
- **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical team data  
- Combined **encoded team features** with numerical features  

---

## **Optimizing Random Forest for Final Model with All Data**
ðŸ“Œ **Final Model F1 Score:** `0.5868`  

---

## **Match Prediction & Betting Strategy**
- **Team Selection & Encoding:** User selects home & away teams (numerical + one-hot encoding)  
- **Feature Extraction:** Retrieves and averages historical team stats  
- **Model Prediction:** Constructs input vector & predicts **win probabilities**  
- **Kelly Criterion Betting Strategy:** User inputs odds, and the model **calculates optimal bet size**  
- **Final Recommendation:** Displays **win probabilities, betting advice, and Kelly Criterion values**  

---

## **Prediction Workflow**
The final model requires **four user inputs**:  
1. **Home Team**  
2. **Away Team**  
3. **Home Team Odds** *(from Betway)*  
4. **Away Team Odds** *(from Betway)*  

The model predicts the **outcome** of the game using the trained **Random Forest model** and provides the **optimal bet percentage** based on the **Kelly Criterion**.

# **V1**
### **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate betting odds into the model.
- Adjust the weighting of features or add/remove values.
- Automate data scraping from sports websites.
- Create a user-friendly interface.

### **Model Development**
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Home/Visitor Win Rate Over Last 10 Games**: F1 = **0.51**.
   - **Season Win Rate for Home and Away Teams**: F1 = **0.5096**.
   - **Home Team is Stronger (Ranking Comparison)**: F1 = **0.5226**.

2. **Encoding Teams**:
   - Teams were one-hot encoded (32 teams).
   - **Decision Tree Model**: F1 = **0.5654**.
   - **Random Forest Model**: F1 = **0.5823**.

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Merging team encodings with additional features improved performance:
     - **Decision Tree Model**: F1 = **0.5032**.
     - **Random Forest Model (Optimized)**: F1 = **0.6381**.

4. **Final Model**:
   - The optimized Random Forest model achieves an F1 score of **0.6381**, indicating "decent" performance in predicting game outcomes.

---

### **Results**
- **Improvement in F1**:
  - Baseline F1 Score â‰ˆ **0.37**.
  - Final Model F1 Score = **0.63**.
  - Absolute Improvement: **26%**.

- **Relative Improvement in Accuracy**:
  - Assuming accuracy aligns closely with F1, the model likely predicts ~63% of games correctly, compared to the **53.6% baseline**.
  - Approximate Accuracy Improvement: **9.4%**.

---

### **Prediction Workflow**
The final code takes two inputs:
1. Home team.
2. Away team.

The model predicts the outcome of the game using the trained Random Forest model.
