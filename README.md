## **Predicting NHL Game Outcomes**

The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts NHL game outcomes with an edge over traditional betting sites, which often rely on human sentiment and can be biased.

---

### **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate betting odds into the model.
- Adjust the weighting of features or add/remove values.
- Automate data scraping from sports websites.
- Create a user-friendly interface.

### **Project Overview**
1. **Data Source**:
   - The project starts with data extracted from an Excel file containing historic NHL games from the 2024-2025 season.
   - Additional data manipulation is currently performed in Excel but could be automated in Python in the future.

2. **Home Advantage**:
   - Home teams historically have a higher win rate due to factors like travel, crowd support, and familiarity with the venue.
   - In this dataset, the overall home win rate is **53.6%**.

3. **Objective**:
   - Beat the baseline home win rate using machine learning models.
   - Track model performance throughout the season and make incremental improvements.

---

### **Model Evaluation**
The primary evaluation metric is the **F1 Score**, which balances precision and recall to measure model quality.
- **Baseline F1 Score** (assuming the home team always wins): **0.37**.

---

### **Model Development**
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Home/Visitor Win Rate Over Last 10 Games**: F1 = **0.51**.
   - **Season Win Rate for Home and Away Teams**: F1 = **0.5096**.
   - **Home Team is Stronger (Ranking Comparison)**: F1 = **0.5226**.

2. **Encoding Teams**:
   - Teams were one-hot encoded (32 teams).
   - **Decision Tree Model**: F1 = **0.5654**.
   - **Random Forest Model**: F1 = **0.5823**.

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Merging team encodings with additional features improved performance:
     - **Decision Tree Model**: F1 = **0.5032**.
     - **Random Forest Model (Optimized)**: F1 = **0.6381**.

4. **Final Model**:
   - The optimized Random Forest model achieves an F1 score of **0.6381**, indicating "decent" performance in predicting game outcomes.

---

### **Results**
- **Improvement in F1**:
  - Baseline F1 Score â‰ˆ **0.37**.
  - Final Model F1 Score = **0.63**.
  - Absolute Improvement: **26%**.

- **Relative Improvement in Accuracy**:
  - Assuming accuracy aligns closely with F1, the model likely predicts ~63% of games correctly, compared to the **53.6% baseline**.
  - Approximate Accuracy Improvement: **9.4%**.

---

### **Prediction Workflow**
The final code takes two inputs:
1. Home team.
2. Away team.

The model predicts the outcome of the game using the trained Random Forest model.

V2 Changes
Changed the binary variable (Higher rank) for the difference in ranks between the 2 teams (Increased the F1 by 0.0061)
